1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

1)To interpret user needs there needs to be a clear list of requirements that need to be handled. These requirements will be gotten from the customers and clarifications and changes will be gotten from the product owner.  If user stories are made for each function then there will be a strong list of what has to be made and what needs to be included in it. 
2) I think a good approach in developing programs is to start with planning. Creating backlogs and giving them all a preferred order. Then there needs to be sprint planning. After that its time to start building. 
3) To be a good team member in software development you need to be honest with you abilities. You need to ask questions and be realistic about what you can and can not do. You have to be open when thighs are challenging and ask for help, but also be willing to give help where you can.
